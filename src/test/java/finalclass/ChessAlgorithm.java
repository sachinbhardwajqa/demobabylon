    /*
    We can declare some or all of a class's methods final.
    We use the final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
    The Object class does thisâ€”a number of its methods are final.

    Methods called from constructors should generally be declared final.
    If a constructor calls a non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method
    with surprising or undesirable results.

    Note that we can also declare an entire class final.
    A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed.
    This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String class.
