    /*Instance Methods
    * An instance method in a subclass with the same signature (name, plus the number and the type of its parameters)
    * and return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the superclass's method.
    *
    * An overriding method can also return a subtype of the type returned by the overridden method.
    * This subtype is called a covariant return type.
    *
    * Static Methods
    * If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass,
    * then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass.
    *
    * Distinction between hiding a static method and overriding an instance method:
    * * The version of the overridden instance method that gets invoked is the one in the subclass.
    * * The version of the hidden static method that gets invoked depends on
    * * * * whether it is invoked from the superclass or the subclass.
    *
    *
    * Example -
    * The static method in Animal
    * The instance method in Cat
    * */
