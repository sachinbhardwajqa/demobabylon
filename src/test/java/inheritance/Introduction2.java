    * Class can have fields but interfaces cannot

    * Class can be instantiate but interfaces cannot
    *
    * Doesn't support multiple inheritance because
    * * avoid the issues of multiple inheritance of state, which is the ability to inherit fields from multiple classes
    * Because interfaces do not contain fields, we do not have to worry about problems
    * * that result from multiple inheritance of state
    *
    * Problems
    * name conflicts and ambiguity
    *
    * Java supports multiple inheritance of type,
    * * which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface
    *
    * An object can have multiple types:
    * * the type of its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements
    * This means that if a variable is declared to be the type of an interface,
    * then its value can reference any object that is instantiated from any class that implements the interface*/
